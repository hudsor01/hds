# TypeScript/ESLint Error Resolution Protocol

## DIRECTIVE

Fix errors sequentially, one file at a time. No explanations needed - just fix and move to next error.

## ORDER OF OPERATIONS

1. Fix error
2. Apply fix
3. Verify that fix did not cause another error.
4. If additional errors detected, continue fixing the current file until 0 errors detected.
5. Move to next error
6. Repeat until all errors resolved

## ERROR RESOLUTION FLOW

### 1. When Finding Error:

```typescript
// BEFORE (with error)
↓
// AFTER (fixed)
↓
// NEXT ERROR
```
````

### 2. Priority Order

- app/auth/\* flows
- app/api/\* routes
- app/dashboared/\* files
- app/page.tsx and app/layout.tsx
- lib/_.ts and types/_.ts files
- components/\* files
- remaining files

## ALWAYS:

1. Fix → Move → Next
2. No explanations unless asked
3. Keep fixes minimal
4. Maintain existing patterns

## NEVER:

1. Stop to explain
2. Refactor working code
3. Change implementation
4. Add new features

Just fix and move on. No need to explain unless asked.
